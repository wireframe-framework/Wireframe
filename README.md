Wireframe ProcessWire module and output framework
-------------------------------------------------

Wireframe is, in the lack of a better term, an output framework for the ProcessWire CMS/CMF. It
loosely follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, introducing concepts such as View
Controllers to ProcessWire site development.

Technically Wireframe is a combination of a ProcessWire module - called Wireframe - and a set of
related classes. Certain features are bundled into a separate module called Wireframe API; this
optional companion module can be used to quickly set up a JSON based API.

This README file provides basic instructions for setting Wireframe up. More detailed instructions
can be found from https://wireframe-framework.com, and if you'd like to see an example site using
Wireframe, be sure to check out https://github.com/wireframe-framework/site-wireframe-boilerplate/.

## Getting started

1. Download and install the Wireframe ProcessWire module

There are a couple of ways to get the module:

- Clone or download from GitHub: https://github.com/wireframe-framework/Wireframe
- Install using Composer: https://packagist.org/packages/wireframe-framework/wireframe

2. Set up the Wireframe directories within the `/site/templates/` directory

If your site already has identically named folders you can call them something else, as long as you
also adjust the paths in config settings (`$config->wireframe` array) accordingly. For more details
visit https://wireframe-framework.com/docs/configuration-settings/.

Alternatively you can install the site-wireframe-boilerplate site profile, available from GitHub:
https://github.com/wireframe-framework/site-wireframe-docs. This is a complete site running on
Wireframe, so you may find it useful if you're just starting a new project, but it's not something
you'd want to use if you've already got an existing site set up.

3. Copy `wireframe.php` from the module's directory to `/site/templates/wireframe.php`

This is the file that bootstraps Wireframe. If you want to pass variables to Wireframe during init
or render phases, you can directly modify this file.

4. Add `wireframe` as the alternate filename of the template(s) you want to use Wirerame for

This can be done via the Alternate Template Filename setting found from the template edit screen,
and will redirect requests for pages using those templates through the Wireframe bootstrap file.

Note: you don't actually have to route *all* your templates through Wireframe. In case you want to
use other output strategies for some of your templates, that will work just fine: just skip step 4
for those templates.
